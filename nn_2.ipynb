    "First: the derivative. Run the next command to plot a sigmoid function. \n",
    "Let's consider that l1 values are the color dots show long the sigmoid, and the lines are their respective derivatives (slopes). The key aspect to notice here is that when x is close to 0 the slope is high (blue dot) and when x gets bigger the slope gets much smaller (green dot). \n",
    "\n",
    "Second: multiplying the derivative by the error in layer 1. By multiplying the slope by the error we are reducing the error of high confidence predictions. For example, if the slope is flat (like in the green dot), it means that the guessed by the network is very high, like x=2, y=0.9 (or very low). This means that the network was quite confident one way or the other. On the other hand, if the network guessed something close to x=0, y=0.5, then it isn't very confident. So, by multiplying the error by the derivative, we relatively amplify the error of not confident estimations compare to the high confident ones. "
