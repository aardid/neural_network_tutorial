This is a set of three jupyter notebook tutorials for developing a basic understanding and tools of neural networks. 
 
Getting Started

(0) Download and install Anaconda (Python distribution): https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
Save the folder NN_tutorial given in the Desktop (or someplace else). 

(1) Open the anaconda promt and go to the NN_tutorial directory (given):
cd (path)\Desktop\NN_tutorial 

(2) Create a conda enviroment and activate it (by typing the folliwing comands in the promt):
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate nn_env

(3) install and open jupyter notebook interface (by typing the folliwing comands in the promt):
conda install jupyter 
jupyter notebook 

(4) a browser window should open showing the NN_tutorial directory: open nn_1.ipynb. This is the first tutorial. After completion keep going with tutorial nn_2.ipynb and nn_3.ipynb.
