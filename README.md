OVERVIEW

Here you can find a series of three jupyter notebook tutorials to learn about neural networks using Python. 
Follow 'Setup instruccions.pdf' file to install anaconda and the environment. Read 'Some basic and essential concepts for this tutorial.pdf' to learn some basic concepts useful for the tutorial. 
Tutorial one (nn_1.ipynb) covers how to create a deep learning neural network model in Python using the python library Keras (state of the art tool). This will help you to understand the steps to follow when building and neural network model.
Tutorials two and three (nn_2.ipynb and nn_3.ipynb) cover writing a neural network from scratch using essential tools (Python NumPy library). This will help you to understand the math behind neural networks. 
Have fun!

SETUP INSTRUCTIONS

Download and install Anaconda (python distribution): https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual
Save the folder NN_tutorial given in the Desktop. 
(0) Clone the repo (or just download the repo)
git clone https://github.com/aardid/neural_network_tutorial.git

(1) Open the anaconda promt and go to the NN_tutorial directory (given):
cd (path)\Desktop\NN_tutorial 

(2) Create a conda enviroment and activate it (by typing the folliwing comands in the promt):
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate nn_env

(3) install and open jupyter notebook interface (by typing the folliwing comands in the promt):
conda install jupyter 
jupyter notebook 

(4) a browser window should open showing the NN_tutorial directory: open nn_1.ipynb. This is the first tutorial. After completion keep going with tutorial nn_2.ipynb and nn_3.ipynb.# neural_networks_tutorial

Note: Solutions to the tutorial are in the master folder.
